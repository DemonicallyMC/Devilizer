# Devilizer

A sorting visualizer for categorical sorting.

## State of Development

At this early stage, Devilizer is completely bare bones and has only extremely basic functionality which serves as a proof of concept. Nonetheless, the functionality does exist, and it is usable.

### Functionality

Currently, Devilizer only implements uncategorical numerical bubble sorting for a list generated at run time. However, in the future, we plan to implement many more sorting algorithms, different configuration options, and different input sources.

### How to use Devilizer?

To use Devilizer follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that `pipenv` is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. From the root of the repository folder, run `pipenv run python3 -m devilizer`.
   Currently, this will visualize the bubble sort algoirthm.
